\title{Simulate a continuous time finite state space Markov chain}
\description{
This function simulates a single realisation from a continuous time Markov chain having a finite state space based on a given transition rate matrix.
}
\usage{
rcfmc(n,Q,pi0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{The number of states to be sampled from the Markov chain, including the initial state, which will be sampled using pi0.}
  \item{Q}{The transition rate matrix of the Markov chain, where each off-diagonal element Q[i,j] represents the rate of transition from state i to state j. This matrix is assumed to be square, having rows summing to zero.}
  \item{pi0}{A vector representing the probability distribution of the initial state of the Markov chain. If this vector is of length r, then the transition matrix P is assumed to be r x r. The elements of this vector are assumed to be non-negative and sum to one, though in fact, they will be normalised by the sampling procedure.}
}
\value{
An R \code{\link{stepfun}} object containing the sampled path of the process.
